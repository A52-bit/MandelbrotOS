# Welcome
Welcome to the mandelbrot Operating System. 
This OS is built by a humble group of teenagers over at [Discord](https://discord.gg/W523cD3Q3P). 
We do this solely to have fun and to learn. 
We are not organized and are here to enjoy ourselves. 
Sounds appealing? Create a pull request!

# About 
This project is made for fun and learning.
It's like tracing OS history, but with modern knowledge and without a lot of budget lol

# Where are we in the project
- A filesystem is being developed. ATA is somewhat functional but still needs testing.
- We have our own fork of limine which can boot from the flatfs.

# Running
You'll need to have a cross-compiler, build one using `./build-cross-compiler.sh`.
Run `make` to compile the OS and run it in `qemu` (needs `qemu-system-x86_64`) or just `make build` to compile it

# Using
By default the OS does nothing as we don't have a userland but stuff can be added to the kernel for testing purposes.

# Commiting
We code using GCC so any clang standards that may affect GCC will be ignored.
We also format our code in clang format so make sure to clang format the code before commiting.

# Using code
This is an open source project. Reuse code. Just follow the license terms and we are good. :)
