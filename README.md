# Welcome
Welcom to the mandelbrot Operating System. This OS is built by a humble group of teenagers over at [Discord](https://discord.gg/W523cD3Q3P). We do this solely to have fun and to learn. We are not organized and are here to enjoy ourselves. Sounds apealling? Create a pull request. We'll see if we can accomodate you.

# Running
You'll need to have a cross-compiler, build one using `./build-cross-compiler.sh`.
Run `make qemu` to compile the OS and run it in `qemu` (needs `qemu-system-i386`) or just `make` to compile it.

# Using code
This is open source. Reuse code. Just follow the license terms and we are good. :)
